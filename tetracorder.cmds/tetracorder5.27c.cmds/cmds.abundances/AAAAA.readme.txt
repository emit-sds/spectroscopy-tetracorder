This directory contains commands and support files
for computing abundances.  This directory
contains the data for the default EMIT abundance
model is described in AAA.readme.models

The abundances here are a restricted set to a particular
application: the EMIT instrument on the Space Station
to map minerals in arid regions of the Earth for climate
change models to more accurately model the radiative forcing
of dust.  With this limited set of minerals, results may
not be as accurate in other geologic environments, including
other planets.

For installation for a givenm system check the verion of env on your system:
env  --version

if the version is 8.30 or later, do from this directory:

      cp -a  davinci-scripts-env-s/davinci* .

else do nothing, the default install is for pre env 8.30.
A backup copy of these programs are in::

       davinci-scripts-pre-env8.30

Run the abundances command from the mapping directory (the one above this one):

./cmds.abundances/cmd.image.moments.all  |& tee abundances-image.moments.out.txt  # or similar output name

If the images are very large in width and you want to make small
images to put into presentationsm run from the cmds.abundances directory:

./cmd.make.model1.small.images

These commands make images limited to 1280 pixels width

Similarly, from the mapping directory, run

./cmds.color.support/cmd.make.color.results.small.images

to make 1280 pixel images of the color results.  A set of
separate key files are also made.
